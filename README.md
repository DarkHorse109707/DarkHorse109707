# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub!

🚀 **Senior 3D Web & AR/VR Engineer** | **Three.js • React Three Fiber • WebGL • XR**

I'm a Senior Software Engineer obsessed with interactive 3D, AR/VR, and spatial web. My specialty is crafting stunning, performant, and immersive web experiences using **Three.js**, **React Three Fiber (R3F)**, and the latest in WebXR/AR technologies. I love making complex visualizations accessible, and bringing creative visions to life—on the browser, on mobile, and in the real world.

## 🌟 My Core Skill Set

### 🎨 3D Graphics & Visualization
- **Three.js** — Custom shaders, scene management, complex animations, geometry & lighting
- **React Three Fiber (R3F)** — Declarative 3D with React, hooks, Drei, and ecosystem tools
- **WebGL** — Low-level graphics, GLSL shaders, performance optimization

### 🕶️ AR/VR & Spatial Web
- **WebXR** — Building immersive AR/VR for browser and headsets (Meta Quest, Hololens, etc.)
- **AR.js / 8th Wall / Zappar** — Marker & markerless web AR
- **Unity XR** (basic prototyping for cross-platform integration)

### ⚡ Interactive & Creative Coding
- **Procedural Generation** — Terrain, objects, environments
- **Physics & Animation** — use-cannon, react-spring, GSAP, custom rigs
- **3D UI/UX** — Intuitive controls, VR/AR interaction patterns

### 🌐 Frontend & Integration
- **React** (advanced), **TypeScript**, **Redux/Zustand/Jotai**
- **Next.js** — SSR/SSG for 3D sites & interactive portfolios
- **API/Backend** — Node.js, REST, Firebase, GraphQL (for dynamic 3D/AR content)

### 🛠️ DevOps & Tooling
- **Vite, Webpack** — Modern build tools for graphics workflows
- **CI/CD** — Automated deploys for interactive web apps
- **Cloud Functions, CDN** — Serving assets, optimizing 3D pipelines
